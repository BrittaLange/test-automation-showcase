# Test Automation Showcase

## Overview
This repository is a **learning-focused demo project** showcasing professional
end-to-end (E2E) test automation for a PHP-based web application.

The project demonstrates how different E2E testing tools can be structured,
maintained, and integrated into a CI pipeline, while following best practices
commonly used in real-world software projects.

It is designed both as:
- a **technical showcase** of my testing and automation skills, and
- a **learning environment** to compare tools, approaches, and trade-offs.

## Why this project?

End-to-end testing is a critical part of modern software quality assurance,
yet different tools come with very different strengths, limitations, and
maintenance costs.

With this project, I wanted to:

- Demonstrate how I **structure and document** an automation project
- Show how I **evaluate and compare technologies**, not just use them
- Apply **real-world testing strategies**, not toy examples
- Practice **clean code, maintainability, and CI integration**
- Make architectural and tooling decisions explicit and explainable

This repository reflects **how I would approach E2E testing in a professional
environment**, while remaining transparent about learning outcomes and trade-offs.

## Goals

- Build maintainable end-to-end test suites
- Compare multiple E2E testing tools in the same domain
- Practice user-centric test scenarios
- Integrate automated tests into CI
- Document decisions, challenges, and lessons learned

---

## Technologies

- **Playwright** – modern web E2E testing
- **Selenium WebDriver** – established web automation standard
- **Cypress** – fast web testing with developer-friendly experience
- **PHP** – application under test
- **GitHub Actions** – continuous integration
